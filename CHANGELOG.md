# Additional Icon Fonts

## Version 1.1.0

- Fonts are now enabled individually in settings, and the module will only load enabled fonts, reducing world-load bandwidth required.
- Only Material Design is enabled by default.
- No longer ships with SVG fonts for game-icons and jam, since as far as I can tell they were only for old iOS compatibility (shaved ~2/3 of module size).
- Under the hood preparation for Macro & Helper Library release.

## Version 1.0.0

- Add initial icon sets
